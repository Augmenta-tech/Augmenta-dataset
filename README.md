# Augmenta-dataset

Here is a repository of datasets that you can play in the [Augmenta simulator](https://docs.augmenta.tech/get-the-simulator)

### Types

There is currently two types
- Tracking data (containing a collection of data like tracking IDs, position, boundingbox and speed)
- Point clouds (containing point clouds, i.e. people shape)

### Considerations

This is a community repository. All these datasets are provided "as it is".\
These datasets are post processing treatment, that means that they are the data result of the system tunings.\
All the setup conditions, sensors, tunings, and models might be very different from one dataset to another, expect big variations.
